         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>SEPARATION,</hi> which is the Epidemical Diſeaſe of the Time, came to ſuch a height the laſt Summer, <hi>1678.</hi> that like a Flood, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt carried all before it, in many places of the Land. Theſe <hi>DIALOGUES</hi> were then written. The Author living a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a People who were in hazard to be drawen away with the Spait of the Time, thought it his duty to fortifie them againſt the danger, by letting them ſee the ſin, and unwarrantableneſs of theſe dividing Practices, which were now grown to be in faſhion. And this, together with the Activity, and Concurrance of Magiſtrats in the Place, who were careful to ſuppreſs the beginnings of <hi>Schiſm</hi> in the Bud; was found not to be in vain; for through the bleſſing of God that People hath hitherto
<pb facs="tcp:95586:3"/> ſtood their ground: for which, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed deſerve their commendation: though at firſt, ſundry of them out of Novelty, went to field meetings, yet preſently they returned to the ways of Peace, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, a very few excepted. When theſe <hi>DIALOGUES</hi> were firſt written, there was no deſign of making them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, but a Manuſcript coming to the hands of ſome of Note, both for Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Learning; It was their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they ſhould ſee the Light; and that through the bleſſing of God, ſome might receive good by them: yet probably they might had lurked, notwithſtanding of this: But now ſeing it's too evident that theſe Schiſmatical Principles, and Practices are not laid aſide, but endeavours made to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them on vigorouſly as before: It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not only fit, but a matter of conſcience, to diſcover to any who is not unwilling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive information, how unwarrantable, and ſinful ſuch courſes are; If Scripture, and the Doctrine, even of Presbyterian Divines (not to ſpeak of others) ſhall be impartially conſulted, and admitted to be Judge. It may indeed ſeem ſtrange to ſee,
<pb facs="tcp:95586:3"/> not only great numbers of the common mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, but ſundry of better Note, out of zeal to Presbytrie, led away with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of <hi>Separation,</hi> and drinking in the principles of the <hi>Brouniſts:</hi> Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, theſe ills have been zealouſly teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt, and diſputed down, even by Non-conformiſts, and Presbyterians of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and later times. Only the third <hi>DIALOGUE,</hi> which is anent <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> was at firſt intended: But ſeing people make <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> the great grounds of their Separating. It was conceived, that to ſpeak of <hi>Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> alone, would not be enough, unleſs ſomething were firſt ſpoken of the other two, to ſhew what a ſandy ground <hi>Separation</hi> is built upon; Eſpecially if <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> ſhall be found in it ſelf lawful, at leaſt, and the <hi>Covenant</hi> in every caſe not obligatory. In ſpeaking to <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> not only is the meer lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment aſſerted (a thing not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned by any of the Ancients,<note place="margin">

Theſe Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are now ſuffered to go abroad out of real commiſeration towards well meaning but miſled people? Here is brought ſome Water to quench thoſe fierce and unnatural Flames, which threaten to burn this poor Church to aſhes. In the Preface before the Corpus and Syntagma of the Proteſtant confeſſions, <hi>Edit. Genev.</hi> The Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath this great commendation, <hi>Eſt Eccleſiae</hi> Scotica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae <hi>privilegium rarum</hi> prae <hi>multis, quod
<pb facs="tcp:95586:5"/> ſine Schiſmate, nedum Haereſi, unitatem cum puritate Doctrinae retinuerit.</hi> i. e. The Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath this rare priviledge above many others; That (ſince the Reformation) they have without Hereſie, or ſo much as <hi>Schiſm,</hi> retained <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, with purity of Doctrine. O but how have we now lost our good Name! How is the Staff, BANDS, broken in the midſt of us, <hi>Zech. 11.14.</hi> The Author could have wiſhed a work of this nature had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by ſome able hand, or at leaſt this had been in a better dreſs, but now, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, you have it ſuch as it is, and if thou be one concerned, be intreated to lay aſide prejudice: Conſider what a woful thing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion in a Church is, and what the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſequences may be; <hi>A kingdom di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand, ſaith</hi> Chriſt, <hi>Mark 3.24. If we bite and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour one another, take heed we be not conſumed one of another,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, Galat. 5.15. Diſſolution is the daughter of diviſion,</hi> ſaith another; <hi>Omne divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibile eſt corruptibile,</hi> ſaith the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher. <hi>Divide &amp; impera,</hi> ſaith the Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian. <hi>Si collidimur, frangimur,</hi> ſaid the two earthen Pots in the Fable that were
<pb facs="tcp:95586:6"/> ſwiming down the Stream together. Theſe expreſſions tend to ſhew the bad conſequences of diviſion. We have lately received a loud warning from Papiſts to unite: <hi>Rome</hi> knows how to fiſh in our troubled Waters. The Lord convince us of the neceſſity of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, and teach us to keep the <hi>unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace;</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to many what ſmal evidence they give of friendſhip to the Proteſtant Intereſt, by keeping up diviſions.</p>

                  <p>If by Lord <hi>Biſhops</hi> you mean ſuch as have a ſuperiority over ordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, it's clear they were Lord <hi>Biſhops</hi> in that ſenſe: but if you mean <hi>Biſhops</hi> Dignified with Titles of Honour by the ſecular powers, I grant they were not Lord <hi>Biſhops,</hi> nor could look for any the leaſt reſpect from the powers of thoſe times, who for the moſt part were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, either to <hi>Christianity</hi> altogether, or to the Orthodoxy of it. Yet at the time of the Reformation from <hi>Popery</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days, we find ſundry Lord <hi>Biſhops</hi> (as you call them) were <hi>Martyres</hi> for the Truth:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95586:7"/> As for Biſhops their acting in civil affairs ſometimes, I will make it none of my buſineſs to debate it with you. Only that it is not altogether incompatible with Eccleſiaſtical Functions, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from theſe few things. The Jewiſh <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> (made up of the ſeventy El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, at firſt appointed to be aſſiſtants to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the civil Government, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.) did conſiſt partly of Prieſts, which, I ſuppoſe, few verſed in the Jewiſh Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will deny; ſee <hi>Goodwinus,</hi> his <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> lib. 5. Cap. 5. <hi>Junius</hi> on <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. and others. Conſider <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Eli</hi> the Prieſt judged <hi>Iſrael</hi> fourty years, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.18. and after him <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet, (though from his birth lent to the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.28.) went in circuit yearly, judging the people, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. <hi>v,</hi> 15, 16. And under the New Teſtament, how much Biſhops were imployed in Civil Matters, after Emperours became Chriſtian, you may ſee confeſſed by <hi>Smectimnuus,</hi> Sect. 12. Its true Church-men ſhould be as abſtract from theſe incumbrances, as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly they can; nor are they needleſly, or of choice to entangle themſelves, for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95586:8"/> 
                     <hi>no man, &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſome ancient Councils have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged them to follow <hi>Military Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> to take <hi>Farms</hi> or the like. And ſome of the Fathers have complained, that themſelves were too much diverted and overcharged with ſecular matters: Yet its hard to ſay that its abſolutely, and in every caſe unlawful for Church-men to medle in theſe things, for then, it will follow, that a Miniſter may not look after any civil affair that concerns himſelf, and family; and yet whatever Chriſtian neglects this, is worſe then an Infidel, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. Some of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were a gainſt Churchmens being Tutors or Curators, yet, I believe, your ſelves do not ſcruple this now adays, nor Countrey Tryſts neither. I need not tell you how much ſome Miniſters in our late times medled in State affairs; <hi>Saravia</hi> at ſome length defends Church-mens actings in theſe matters. But paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this, I ſuppoſe you queſtion the lawfulneſs of the Epiſcopal-Office it ſelf.</p>

                  <p>If you think all ſuperiority among Church-men there forbidden, you are in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95586:9"/> a miſtake: for, 1. Chriſt there ſpeaks to the twelve, among whom I can grant there was to be no inequality, in reſpect of power, yet they were ſuperior to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty <hi>Diſciples,</hi> whom Chriſt alſo ſent to preach the Goſpel, as Divines com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly think; and appears from <hi>Act.</hi> 1. Where <hi>Matthias</hi> one of the ſeventy, as <hi>Clemens Alexandrin: Dorotheus,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers affirm him to have been; is ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly choſen and advanced to the Office of Apoſtleſhip, in the room of <hi>Judas;</hi> and he was numbred with the eleven Apoſtles, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. 2. The thing <hi>Chriſt</hi> there diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges, is Ambition, and not Inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, otherwiſe the Argument he tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from his own example, <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. would not ſuit his purpoſe: For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controverſie <hi>Christ</hi> was in Power and authority above the twelve. But take the words as ſpoken againſt ambition, or a ſinful deſire of ſuperiority (which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward was <hi>Diotrephes</hi> his fault) the reaſon from his own example ſuits well; for though in power he was above all, yet in humility he was a pattern to all. Humility and Imparity can well conſiſt together.</p>

                     <hi>In the New Testament,</hi> Biſhop <hi>and</hi> Elder <hi>are two words ſignifying one and the ſame Officebearer: for</hi> Act. 20. <hi>theſe who in</hi> verſ. 17. <hi>are called</hi> Elders, verſ. 28. <hi>are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> Biſhops; <hi>alſo,</hi> Tit. 1. verſ. 5. <hi>and</hi> 7. <hi>compared together.

                  <p>I grant theſe two words are ofttimes in the New Teſtament uſed indifferently to expreſs one and the ſame <hi>Officer;</hi> yet it will not be granted, nor can ye ever prove, that the <hi>Officer</hi> meant by theſe words, is never to be underſtood of any above the degree of an ordinary Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or that the word <hi>Presbyter,</hi> or <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> ſignifies only a Miniſter of a ſingle Congregation, and no more. For, 1. We find the name, <hi>Elder,</hi> given to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles themſelves, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Joh.</hi> Epiſt. 2.1. and Epiſt. 3.1.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95586:10"/> that the word, <hi>Elder,</hi> ſignifies not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Preaching Elder or Miniſter, but alſo the Ruling Elder; I can upon as good, and better ground, ſay, It ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Biſhop and the Miniſter, both being Elders, but of different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: and conſonant to this in ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ages, we find thoſe who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably Biſhops, yet ſometimes deſigned by the name of <hi>Presbyter,</hi> that is, <hi>Elder,</hi> Thus we find <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> called <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and <hi>Iraene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> called <hi>Presbyter Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae Lugdunenſis:</hi> Though ordinarly at that time, ſuch were called <hi>Biſhops;</hi> yet ſome times they are called <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> as ſtill remembring the firſt times of the New Teſtament, when the name was indifferently given to Biſhops and Miniſters.</p>

Others think there might be ſundry Biſhops of the Churches about conveened at that time, at <hi>Philippi,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> knowing of this, might write to, and ſalute them together with that Church: For ye ſee, he firſt names all the Saints at <hi>Philippi,</hi> as thoſe to whom he mainly intended to write, and then the Biſhops and Deacons. But granting by theſe Biſhops and Deacons, the Officers of that ſame Church of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi,</hi> to be meant; I ask you where are the Ruling Elders here? If you ſay they are included in the word, <hi>Biſhops,</hi> I can upon better ground affirm, that <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> there ſignifies both the ſuperior Biſhop, and the ordinary Miniſters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him.

Why I pray you, will any have <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to be extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Officers in their acting of theſe things, which they cannot deny are of ordinary uſe in the Church.

                     <hi>I have heard learned men ſay, that theſe Epiſtles are much falſified, ſo that we have them not now, as they were written by</hi> Ignatius: <hi>and therefore any teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny taken from them, is the leſs to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued.</hi>

                  <p>Indeed the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Armagh, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> a man well read in Antiquity, as alſo <hi>Vedelius,</hi> who hath written on thoſe Epiſtles, ſhew, that the Copies of theſe Epiſtles which were uſed, till of late years, are very faulty, which is proved from this, among other things; that many of theſe Quotations, which in the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95586:24"/> Fathers are found to be cited out of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi> are not to be found in thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, as they have been uſed. But of late years, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> found two very ancient Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts of theſe Epiſtles in ſome Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in <hi>England,</hi> and about that ſame time <hi>Iſ: Voſſius</hi> found a Greek Manuſcript of them at <hi>Florence;</hi> All which three Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies agreed together, and differed much from theſe, that were uſed before: and in theſe three were found the Fathers Quotations, which were not found in the old ones: and even in theſe late found Copies, the Teſtimonies for <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> are moſt clear and full. And this ſo much troubles <hi>Blondel</hi> in the Preface to his <hi>Apologia</hi> that he is forced to ſeek a new ſhift, <hi>viz.</hi> that even thoſe Epiſtles, as we have them in the Copies found by <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> and <hi>Voſſius,</hi> are vitiat alſo: and thinks the Fathers who cite them, were deceived by them: he thinks they have been vitiat, or forged about the year 180. <hi>Salmaſius</hi> thinks, <hi>Circiter me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium aut initium ſecundi ſeculi,</hi> about the middle, or beginning of the ſecond age: Now <hi>Ignatius</hi> lived about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſecond age; and is it
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95586:24"/> probable they could then be medled with? The reaſons for this forging of them, are alledged by <hi>Blondel,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by Doctor <hi>Hammond.</hi> Can it be imagined they ſhould be ſo far vitiat that the very Scope of ſundry of them ſhould be altered, which is to perſwade obedience to the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> as he without whom nothing ought to be done, as they would avoid Schiſm, The Divines who debated with the King, at the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> found themſelves ſo pinched with theſe Epiſtles, that they found no way to eſcape, but utterly to reject them all as counterfeit: Which, the King told them, they did without any regard, either of Ingenuity, or Truth. Sure I am neither <hi>Scultetus,</hi> nor <hi>Rivet,</hi> did preſume to do ſo; for ſeven of theſe Epiſtles they own as written by <hi>Ignatius;</hi> Howbeit, they think ſome corruptions through time, had crept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: which corruptions they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: but ſay not, that their menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning of <hi>Biſhops</hi> as Superiour to <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> is one of theſe corruptions. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, had theſe two judicious Divines thought this a corruption crept into
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95586:25"/> theſe Epiſtles, they would have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and mentioned it. You may ſee <hi>Scultetus</hi> in his <hi>Medulla patrum.</hi> And <hi>Rivet</hi> in his <hi>Criticus ſacer,</hi> what their judgementis of theſe Epiſtles. But now of late, Doctor <hi>Pearſon</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> hath largely and fully vindicat <hi>Ignatius,</hi> his Epiſtles; and therefore to him I refer you.</p>

                  <p>By that ſame reaſon you ſhould make the <hi>Biſhop</hi> no greater then the <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi> neither, ſince it's ſaid alſo, <hi>Te Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coni non ut majorem obſervent,</hi> that is, let not the Deacons reverence thee, as one greater than themſelves: Yea, you will make him inferiour to both, for it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Sed ut Miniſtrum Chriſti,</hi> that is, as Chriſts Miniſter. <hi>Pius</hi> there exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Justus</hi> to humility, (a very neceſſar and ſeaſonable counſel for theſe who are promoted to higher dignity above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95586:26"/> Soterem, iſti Eleutherium: in ſingulis ſucceſſionibus &amp; civitatibus ita habet ſicut lex &amp; dominus praedicant,</hi> that is, He ſtayed at <hi>Rome</hi> till the time <hi>Anicetus</hi> was made Biſhop, to whom <hi>Soter</hi> ſucceeded, and to him <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> and that in all the ſucceſſions, and Cities matters were conſtitute, as the Law and the Prophets, and the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> did Preach. Then ſpeaking of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he ſays, after <hi>James,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Juſtus,</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Martyrdom, his Uncle <hi>Simeon</hi> was made biſhop, whom all preferred, becauſe he was <hi>Domini Conſobrinus,</hi> a couſin of Chriſts.

From which Teſtimonies of <hi>Hegeſippus,</hi> we may gather, 1. That he ſpeaks of Biſhops in all theſe Churches which he mentions. 2. In every Church he ſpeaks but of one <hi>Biſhop</hi> at a time, to whom, when he is gone, another ſucceedeth: Yet I hope it will not be denyed by you,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95586:27"/> that there were ſundry <hi>Miniſters</hi> or <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> in any one of theſe Churches, at one and the ſame time. 3.

That ſome were then ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of a Biſhoprick, as he reporteth of <hi>Thebulis,</hi> which alſo was <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> his fault. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> All this ſo ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Apoſtles times, that none have any reaſon to doubt of <hi>Hegeſippus,</hi> his certain knowledge what had been the Government of the Church from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles times, to his own time, more than we can doubt what hath been the Government of the Church among our ſelves for fourty years bygone: For <hi>Hegeſippus</hi> lived next after the firſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Apoſtles, as <hi>

And though <hi>Jerome</hi> on <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. take occaſion from the Community of Name, that the Apoſtle there uſes, while he calls the <hi>Presbyter, Biſhop, ver:</hi> 5. and 7. compared together, to ſhew, that at firſt there were no Biſhops above Preſbyters: yet this will not neceſſarily infer that there was no diſtinction of Office betwixt <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> when the Apoſtle wrot to <hi>Titus,</hi> or that <hi>Jerome</hi> thought there
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95586:34"/> was no ſuch diſtinction then: But that as the names were then promiſcuouſly uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apoſtle, ſo ſometimes there was no diſtinction of the Offices, till neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty introduced it, which change <hi>Jerome</hi> takes occaſion to ſpeak of from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of Name ſtill uſed by the Apoſtle even after the change was made. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> becauſe that decree which <hi>Jerome</hi> ſays was made over all the world for intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Biſhops; had it been after the Apoſtles times, we ſhould have ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it in antiquity, about what year, after what manner, in what Council, &amp;c. that Decree was made, and no change that followed upon it: but the veſtige of this is to be found. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch an univerſal change of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after the Apoſtles were gone, will infer, that ſhortly after the Apoſtles there was an univerſal defection in all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world from that Government, which ye think the Apoſtles left as unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable in the Church: which is very hard to imagine.

Now to think, that the Apoſtles left a Government in the Church, which was liable to this great inconvenience of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and that thoſe who came after ſaw cauſe to change that Government unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for ſhunning of the foreſaid evil; Is too great an Imputation upon the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Apoſtles, and too great a preferring of Poſterity before them: But this is ſalv'd, if we ſay, that the Apoſtles themſelves, forſeeing that parity would breed Schiſm, did before their departure for preventing of this, ſet Biſhops over Preſbyters. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> becauſe this ſame <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> in ſundry places of his writings, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives the Original of Biſhops, as high as the Apoſtles, if not higher, <hi>de Scriptor.

                  <p>Some are of opinion that <hi>Jerome</hi> ſpeaks of that authority Biſhops were then inveſted with over Preſbyters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what the firſt Biſhops were; this, he ſaith, they had attained to by cuſtom:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95586:36"/> for in the ſame Epiſtle he maketh three ſubordinate degrees of Clergy, and that <hi>Ex traditione Apoſtolica,</hi> By Apoſtolical Tradition (which words have much perplexed thoſe of your perſwaſion) So that, if you think <hi>Jerome</hi> by, <hi>Conſuetudo,</hi> meaneth <hi>Cuſtome which came in after the Apoſtles times,</hi> you ſhall make him ſay, and unſay in one and the ſame Epiſtle. But if by, <hi>Conſuetudo,</hi> be meant that <hi>Authority</hi> the Biſhops in his time did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, beyond what the firſt Biſhops did, no ſuch inconvenience will follow. And that he is ſo to be underſtood ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from this, that in equalling the <hi>Biſhop</hi> as he was at firſt with the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Quid facit</hi> Epiſcopus, <hi>quod non facit</hi> Preſbyter, <hi>Excepta Ordinatione,</hi> That is, <q>What doth the Biſhop, which the Preſbyter doth not, except <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:</hi>
                     </q> Where you ſee, though he make the Biſhop above the Presbyter as to <hi>Ordination,</hi> yet he ſeemeth to equal them as to <hi>Juriſdiction.</hi> And this ſeems agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to what he ſaith, that at firſt, <hi>inter plures Eccleſiae cura diviſa,</hi> and, <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni Presbyterorum conſilio gubernatae Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae.</hi> i. e. <q>Presbyters did at firſt by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb facs="tcp:95586:37"/> counſel govern the Churches, which doth not neceſſarily exclude the firſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</q> And afterward ſpeaking of the power that accreſced in after times to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, he ſaith, <hi>ad unum omnis Eccleſiae cura delata eſt,</hi> all the care of the Church was put over upon one. He ſeems to mean, that the Biſhops afterward acted ſolely, to avoid ſchiſm that aroſe from the diſagreeing of many Counſels, thus ſome anſwer that place of <hi>Jerome.</hi> 2. Others, as the learned <hi>Davenant,</hi> think, That by, <hi>dominicae diſpoſitionis veritas, Jerome</hi> meant <hi>Chriſt's expreſs Command,</hi> and by, <hi>Conſuetudo, Apostolical practice begun by the Apoſtles, and continued by their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</hi> And this is very probable, for this ſame <hi>Jerome</hi> writing, <hi>ad Marcellum,</hi> about the obſervation of <hi>Lent,</hi> ſaith, it is <hi>apoſtolica traditio,</hi> and <hi>adverſus Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferianos,</hi> calleth it <hi>Eccleſiae conſuetudo,</hi> ſo that according to him, what was begun by the Apoſtles may be called <hi>Church cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> becauſe continued by the Church, So then, this will be <hi>Jerom's</hi> meaning, <hi>Biſhops are greater than Presbyters, not by Chriſt's expreſs Command, but by cuſtome brought into the Church by the Apoſtles and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95586:37"/> continued by their Succeſſors.</hi> And now to ſay no more of this Father, whom you take to be the great prop of your Cauſe in antiquity; conſider ſeriouſly theſe few things anent him, 1. Doth not <hi>Jerome</hi> expreſly ſpeak of an Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical right, at leaſt, that Epiſcopacy hath, and that in very many places of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, as I hinted before. 2. Where he ſeems to ſpeak otherwiſe, ſuppoſe he were to be underſtood in your meaning, which is, to make Biſhops of later date than the Apoſtles: Yet doth he not with all ſay, that there was a neceſſity of bringing Biſhops into the Church, that thereby Schiſm might be put out and kept out? And that this was done by a Decree through the whole Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an World. And, 3. Did he not approve of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> from it's firſt Inſtitution, down to his own time, as ſtill neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for preſerving Unity and Peace in the Church? and ſubmitteth to it. Now would ye all thus far go along with <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> our conteſts about Biſhops and their firſt riſe, might ſoon ceaſe. Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> on <hi>Revel. pag.</hi> 227. anſwering the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that all antiquity did condemn
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95586:38"/> 
                     <hi>Aerius,</hi> becauſe he took away all diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt Biſhop and Presbyter, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, that <hi>Aerius</hi> was condemned, not ſimply as maintaining any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to truth in this, but as imprudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brangling the order than eſtabliſhed in the Church, to the hazard of their Union: Now ſetting aſide the diſpute anent the antiquity of Biſhops.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95586:38"/> ſame neceſſity of ſetting one Arch-biſhop over many Biſhops, and one Patriarch over ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Arch-biſhops, and one Pope over all; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you imagine there is hazard of Schiſm only among Presbyters and not among Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Arch-biſhops.</hi>

And further, that for order's ſake there was one <hi>Patriarch</hi> above the reſt of the Patriarchs, with a certain kind of Priority, who was called <hi>Epiſcopus Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae

                     <hi>Beza</hi> looked not upon all kind of Epiſcopacy as unlawful, as you do, it's true he thought Epiſcopacy but an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95586:49"/> Inſtitution, as he expounds his <hi>Epiſcopus humanus,</hi> yet he was far from your way of condemning Epiſcopacy ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, but thought it a lawful and uſeful order in the Church. In his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with <hi>Saravia,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Si qui ſunt (Quod ſane mihi non facile perſuaſeris) qui omnem Epiſcoporum ordinem rejiciunt, abſit ut quiſquam ſanae mentis furoribus illo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum aſſentiatur,</hi> i. e.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95586:49"/> your authority.</q> Thus <hi>Beza</hi> ſpeaks to that Biſhop, and thinks his authority ought to be reverenced. And in the cloſe of that ſame Epiſtle, he ſaith, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus te cuſtodiat, &amp; in tanto tibi commiſſo munere ſancto ſuo ſpiritu regat, &amp; magis ac magis confirmet.</hi> i. e. <q>Jeſus preſerve you, govern, and more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm you by his holy ſpirit, in that great Office which is committed to you.</q> And <hi>Epist.</hi> 58.

That he did not think <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> unlawful, elſe would he have wiſhed the continuance of an unlawful, ſinful Government in <hi>England,</hi> as I ſhew you a little before expreſly he doth? 2. If <hi>Beza</hi> thought Preſbytrie the firſt and Apoſtolical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, yet certainly he judged it not unalterable, otherwiſe would he have ſpoken with ſuch reſpect of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> as you ſee he doth.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95586:50"/> 61. Certainly theſe Bs. if they thought not Epiſcopacy, <hi>jure divino,</hi> neither thought they Presbytry ſo, elſe would they have been Biſhops themſelves?

Speaking of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> ſaith, he is of the mind that Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy was the Government that <hi>Calvin</hi> approved moſt, and that he took it to be of Apoſtolical Inſtitution; though his opinion was, that the Church according to her exigencies, in relation to places, times, and other circumſtances, may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with it. Thus he ſpeaks of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> and ſubjoyneth a paſſage out of his Epiſtle to Cardinal <hi>Sadolet,</hi> which he conceiveth is to that purpoſe; <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinam qualem habuit vetus eccleſia nobis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe, neque nos diffitemur,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Now do not theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions amount to as much as a yielding of the whole Cauſe. But let us allow any of thoſe four Divines as long a time after the Apoſtles as they will demand before Biſhops were introduced: and we ſhall hear <hi>Blondel</hi> ſay, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of <hi>jus divinum Miniſterij Anglic. Pag.</hi> 124. from him, that before the year 140. there was not a Biſhop over Preſbyters, and that the, <hi>Toto orbe decretum,</hi> in <hi>Jerome</hi> was not long before the ſaid year 140. Thus <hi>Blondel</hi> who takes the longeſt time for bringing in Biſhops, yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges them ſo early, that within 40. years and leſs, after the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> Biſhops are every where ſettled in the Church. Now from your opinion of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95586:52"/> the unalterableneſs of Preſbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment left by the Apoſtles, and from <hi>Blondel's</hi> conceſſion, that within leſs than 40. years of the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> Biſhops were by an univerſal decree received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church: I thus reaſon. If there were <hi>Biſhops</hi> found in the Church within leſs then 40. years after the Apoſtles times, there behoved to be <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the Apoſtles times, otherwiſe one of theſe abſurdities will follow, none of which can be admitted. 1. That that Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtians who lived about 40. years and leſs after the Apoſtles, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant of Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles mind anent the continuing of <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian parity</hi> as the unalterable form of Government, elſe they would not have adventured, and that ſo unanimouſly upon a change of that Government which had a <hi>jus divinum,</hi> for it's warrant. And is this probable, or is it poſſible, that thoſe who lived ſo near to the Apoſtles, that without queſtion, ſundry of them had ſeen <hi>John</hi> and converſed with him: That theſe, I ſay, ſhould all be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of <hi>John's</hi> mind anent Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Or elſe it will follow (which is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95586:52"/> yet worſe) that that Generation brought in <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> notwithſtanding they knew Chriſt and his Apoſtles had left <hi>Parity</hi> as unalterable in the Church. And that thus over the belly of knowledge and conſcience, they did all as oneman (for we hear not of the leaſt oppoſition, as we read there was againſt other Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which perverſe and Heretical Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits laboured to bring early into the Church) conſpire againſt Chriſt and his Apoſtles Government. Were not this hard to be imagined, that thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who were daily dying for Chriſt and the Goſpel, ſhould at the ſame time be guilty of bringing into the Church, a Government contrary to his mind: and that againſt their own light? What remains then, but this, if within four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years after the Apoſtles, <hi>Biſhops</hi> were generally received in the Chriſtian world, by the confeſſion of your ableſt Writers; there behoved to be <hi>Biſhops</hi> even in the Apoſtles time. For it is not conceivable how ſuch a great change ſhould be made in ſo ſhort a time; and that without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny noiſe or oppoſition, for any thing we hear, unleſs you admit theſe abſurdities,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95586:53"/> which I think you will be loath to do. For had there been either knowledge or conſcience in but a few, whither Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or other Chriſtians of that time; is it poſſible they would have ſuffered that change, which imported ſo groſs a viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, paſs ſo ſmoothly, and without ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great contradiction? But further, to let you ſee that thoſe Divines come e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as great a length as needeth to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. <hi>Blondel</hi> in his <hi>Apologia, Pag.</hi> 25. Speaking of the very firſt meetings of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, that were in the beginning of Chriſtianity, he ſaith, <hi>Antiquiſſimo inter Collegas primatus contigit,</hi> i. e. The prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy fell upon the eldeſt, and <hi>Pag.</hi> 53. he grants, that this firſt Preſbyter had the chief hand in Ordination: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that it was for this place that <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trephes</hi> made ſo much ado, and is called by the Apoſtle <gap reason="foreign">

And <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier</hi> confeſſeth that there was always from the beginning, a <hi>Primus Presbyter</hi> or firſt Miniſter, and that he had <hi>Novam poteſtatem &amp; Jurisdictionem, ne eſſet</hi> Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copatus <hi>merus titulus,</hi> i. e. <q>A new pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Juriſdiction, that his Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy might not be a meer title.</q> This he confeſſeth when preſſed with Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies out of antiquity. And what needs more than we find <hi>Blondel</hi> and him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing. And <hi>Moulen</hi> in <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3. to Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> at laſt granteth, that <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Epiſcopalis eſt juris Apoſtolici,</hi> i. e. The Epiſcopal Order is by Apoſtolical right: and then leſt he ſhould ſeem by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion altogether to have yielded up the Cauſe to the Biſhop: he ſubjoyneth a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95586:54"/> diſtinction betwixt <hi>jus Apoſtolicum,</hi> and <hi>jus divinum.</hi> And that although he grant Epiſcopacy to have <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, yet that will not infer a <hi>Divine</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable warrant; for, ſaith he, ſome things which were brought into the Church by Apoſtolical prudence, as fit for that time, are now abrogate as <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coneſſes. Stillingfleet</hi> in his <hi>Irenicum, Pag.</hi> 230. uſeth this ſame evaſion. To whom the <hi>learned and judicious Author of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ancient Church-government,</hi> among other things returns this anſwer, that it's granted, that ſome Apoſtolical practices, yea, and conſtitutions are alterable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were introduced by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, upon reaſons and conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons not holding equally for all places, times and perſons: but if ſome be thus alterable, yet it follows not that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any or all are ſo. And then the queſtion will be, who ſhall judge what practices are alterable, what not? or when the reaſons of them are diſpenſable, when not? Now I ſuppoſe none can ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſay, that any private man, or leſſer part of a Society is competent Judge of theſe practices and reaſons; elſe what
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95586:54"/> confuſion will enſue, every one eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing, or abrogating what he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but this belongeth to the Church in her Repreſentativ's; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we find <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and declared <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the Apoſtles, through many Centuries of years, as the ſtanding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable Apoſtolical Government, and that reaſons of its firſt Inſtitution do hold ſtill, to wit, preſervation of Unity, ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Schiſm and the like: But theſe Apoſtolical practices which were found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on temporary reaſons and occaſions, were permitted to run into a deſuetude. Thus you ſee what ſhifts the ableſt Pens who have ſet themſelves againſt Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, are driven unto, to ſhun a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. And truely by their great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions which they are forced to from evidence in antiquity, they yield the whole Cauſe. Hence it is we find them ſpeaking ſo uncertainly in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. Sometime one would think diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting down all <hi>Biſhops,</hi> or rather up <hi>Presbytrie:</hi> at an other time ſetting up <hi>Biſhops</hi> higher, and more early than their purpoſe can well allow, or conſiſt with

And to them I may add our own <hi>John Knox,</hi> who, as is to be ſeen before the old Pſalm Book, in the year 1560. preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> at the admiſſion of the <hi>ſuperintendent</hi> of the three <hi>Lothians</hi> (a diocy large enough) which act was more Epiſcopal like than Preſbyterian. Thus I have deduced unto you <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> from Scripture, from the moſt primitive times which followed after the Apoſtles, and from the confeſſions and conceſſions of the ableſt Proteſtant Divines: all which, I think, ought, and will be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing to any who is pleaſed to lay aſide prejudice, and impartially make ſearch after truth in this point.</p>
                  <p>To what I have ſaid before, I add theſe few things. The Author of <hi>Jus Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Miniſterij Anglicani,</hi> are at great pains to produce ſome Fathers, School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſome Epiſcopal Divines in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> who were of opinion, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Presbyter</hi> and <hi>Biſhop</hi> there is little or no difference. To which, I ſay, that the debate among the Schoolmen is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95586:56"/> whether Biſhop and Preſbyter, are <hi>diverſi ordines,</hi> different orders, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>diverſi gradus ejuſdem ordinis,</hi> divers degrees of one and the ſame Order. Now this ſays nothing againſt Epiſcopacy, for even theſe, who think they differ only in degree, yet notwithſtanding might be of the mind, that always from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles downward there were Biſhops diſtinct from Preſbyters; howbeit the difference was not ſo great as to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a different Order, but only a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degree, or eminency (as ſome ſpeak) in the ſame Order. And theſe Fathers, and late Epiſcopal Divines might be of the ſame mind. This is ſure, all of them looked on Epiſcopacy as lawful and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Church.</p>
                  <p>The ſaid Authors of <hi>Jus Divinum Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt. Angli. Pag.</hi> 64. ſay, that <hi>Euſebius, Irenaeus</hi> and others, &amp;c. were in many things deceived themſelves, and the cauſe of deceiving others. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. They are hard put to it when they ſeek to relieve themſelves by diſcrediting theſe ancients. 2. Suppone it were granted that <hi>Euſebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was in ſome things deceived, muſt he therefore all along be deceived when he
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95586:56"/> ſpeaks of Biſhops ſuperior to Preſbyters. He makes it a great part of his work to ſet down the ſucceſſion of Biſhops in the moſt famous Primitive Churches, and to ſay, that in all this he was deceived, is <hi>Gratis dictum,</hi> ſaid, but not proved. 3. It's ſtrange if alſo <hi>Irenaeus</hi> was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who flouriſhed above a hundred years before <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and had ſeen <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp,</hi> who was the Apoſtle <hi>John's</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary and diſciple. Who can believe he could be ignorant what the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church had been from the Apoſtles downward, living ſo near to their times. 4. Is it not much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that <hi>Jerome</hi> might be deceived, if we underſtand him to ſpeak of the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of Biſhops after the Apoſtles times? Certainly it is more like he might be miſtaken than either <hi>Euſebius</hi> or <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> who lived long before him. They ſay further, that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> by Biſhops meant no more but Preſbyters, <hi>Pag.</hi> 114, 115. And <hi>Pag.</hi> 65. that the Fathers and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils ſpake of Church-Officers of former times, according to the Stile of their own times. And again when preſſed with the Catologues of Biſhops out of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95586:57"/> others, they ſay, that theſe Biſhops were only the firſt ordained Preſbyters, and therefore this firſt ordained Preſbyter is named and the reſt paſſed by for the more expedit reckoning, and the Line of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion only drawn from the firſt ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miniſter. Some of theſe anſwers are inconſiſtent; For 1. They ſay, <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> were deceived when they ſpoke of Biſhops: and next they ſay that by the Biſhops, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> only meant Preſbyters. Now how unſatisfactory theſe anſwers and the like are, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Reader may judge. Only hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Becauſe King <hi>James</hi> and his <hi>Council</hi> who were the impoſers of that Covenant, and took it themſelves, <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. did the very next year after 1581. ratifie the agreement made at <hi>Leith</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Commiſſioners of State and Church, <hi>Anno</hi> 1571. Which agreement was in favours of Epiſcopacy. Now if the King and his Council had by the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Hierarchy</hi> meant all kind of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95586:62"/> is it probable that the very next year they would by that Ratification have acted ſo palpably contrary to the Covenant ſo lately taken by themſelves, and impoſed upon the Land by their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. 2. That <hi>Proteſtant Epiſcopacy</hi> was not meant, appeareth from this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in all the ſtrivings the Church in thoſe times had with the King to get him to put away <hi>Biſhops</hi> even after the taking of that <hi>Covenant,</hi> we never find this uſed as an argument to perſwade the King, becauſe all <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was abjured in the <hi>Covenant.</hi> Which reaſon, no doubt, would much have been inſiſted on, if Miniſters then had thought all kind of Epiſcopacy to be meant by the <hi>Popes wicked Hierarchy;</hi> and their not uſing this argument may be very convincing to any, that by the <hi>Popes Hierarchy</hi> no Epiſcopacy could be meant, but ſuch as depended upon the <hi>Pope:</hi> for I ſuppoſe the Miniſters of that time were not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the meaning of theſe words of the Covenant.

Now what a poor, <hi>becauſe,</hi> this is, and how weakly reaſoned from the Popes ſaying ſo, <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> is too evident to any ordinary capacity. The
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:95586:63"/> 
                     <hi>Apologiſt</hi> reaſoneth like a Papiſt, that maintaineth the Popes infallibility, and giveth him that advantage of his arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſupremacy and uſurpation over all Biſhops in the Chriſtian world now and from the beginning; as if the very firſt Biſhops in the primitive times had depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope craveth no better than this. But herein Proteſtants oppoſe his uſurped Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ſhew from antiquity that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> have been oppoſed by Councils and Fathers, when firſt they attempted the Supremacy. Remember what I cited to you from <hi>Calvin,</hi> at our laſt meeting, <hi>Talem ſi nobis Hierarchiam exhibeant in qua Epiſcopi a Chriſto ut uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co capite dependeant, tum nullo non Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themate,</hi> &amp;c <hi>Calvin</hi> thinks them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a curſe, who will not ſubmit to ſuch Biſhops, who renouncing the Pope, take Chriſt for their head.

                  <p>You would all along remember in this debate, that at our laſt conference I ſhew you, Epiſcopacy had a Divine, or Apoſtolical warrant at leaſt: and if ſo, then the Covenant againſt Epiſcopacy (ſuppone it were there abjured) is null from the beginning. But paſſing this, to what you ſay of the Aſſembly of <hi>Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow</hi>'s expounding the Popes <hi>Hierarchy</hi> to be meant of all Epiſcopacy, I anſwer, that was more than they could do; For 1. How could the Aſſembly put a ſenſe upon that Oath, that was taken 58. years before, and few or none of the firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of it were than alive; or if alive, few or none were Members of that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly? How then could the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly come to know certainly, that their expoſition of the word, <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> was according to the mind of the firſt impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:95586:64"/> 2. All that the Aſſembly 1638. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces in their Act <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 16. to prove E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy to be abjured in the National Covenant amounts only to this, That the Church about the time of the firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of that <hi>Covenant,</hi> and after, was la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring againſt Biſhops; but proves not that <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was abjured in it, or in any words of it. 3. By what warrant could the Aſſembly impoſe upon others that ſenſe of the Covenant in which they took it themſelves; they might declare their own ſenſe of it, which might not be the ſenſe of the firſt impoſers, when all is done: but how could they oblige o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to their ſenſe, who had taken it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? The firſt impoſers gave the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly no power to do ſo.</p>

                  <p>By <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> cannot be meant Preſbyterian Government, becauſe at the time of the firſt impoſing of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant there was no ſuch Government in <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor for a conſiderable time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Whatever eſſays Miniſters in thoſe times made to introduce it, yet the King
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95586:65"/> who impoſed that Covenant, owned Epiſcopacy. Therefore, 2. If by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, ſome one particular mode of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be meant, it's more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that it muſt be <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> becauſe it was the Government then practiſed in this Church: And the very year after the King and Council ratified the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that had been concluded at <hi>Leith</hi> in favours of Epiſcopacy, <hi>Anno</hi> 1571.

                  <p>My denying the preſent <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> of this Church to be meant in either of the Covenants, is grounded upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which I ſuppoſe can not eaſily be diſapproven. And to what you ſay, that upon our acknowledging the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> to be meant in both, or either of the <hi>Covenants,</hi> we could not but acknowledge our ſelves guilty of <hi>Perjury:</hi> Though I ſee no reaſon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this preſent Government to be meant in either of the <hi>Covenants,</hi> but much reaſon to the contrary, yet I am content to make the ſuppoſition that it is abjured: giving then, though not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was abjured in one, or both of the <hi>Covenants,</hi> you cannot ſo eaſily conclude thence, as you imagine, that therefore thoſe who took that <hi>Oath,</hi> and now again ſubmit to, yea, or

                  <p>That you may receive anſwer to this, you muſt conſider the nature of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> which is the matter ſuppoſed to be abjured. <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> is either a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary unalterable Government, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Divine warrand, or at leaſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick,</hi> which amounts to little leſs then <hi>Divine,</hi> if to any thing leſs at all. Or it is an unlawful, ſinful Government, as being contrary to ſome other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which hath the warrant of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Or, 3. It is of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Nature, neither commanded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or forbidden, but left to Chriſtian pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to be uſed in the Church, or not, as ſhall be found expedient, all circumſtances conſidered. If <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> be found grounded on the Word, and to have been the only Government practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the Apoſtles own times down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward through the pureſt ages of the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95586:69"/> Church, I hope you will not think an Oath taken againſt it obliges to any thing but repentance, for engaging in ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable an Oath. You are a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who cry out <hi>Perjury Perjury;</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what I ſaid to you at laſt meeting, to let you ſee what warrant <hi>Biſhops</hi> have in the Word of God, and that it is the only Government found in the firſt and pureſt times of the Church, ſearch when you will, and that even thoſe who have ſet themſelves to maintain another Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, have from evidence of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Light that ſhines to them out of Antiquity, been forced by their own conceſſions to ſet <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> high enough: and till you be able ſolidly to anſwer what I ſaid to you then on this head, be more ſober, and ſparing of your hard cenſures: and take heed leſt while you charge others with <hi>Perjury,</hi> your ſelves be found doing all you can ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to robb the Church of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> left her in poſſeſſion of, and have bound your ſelves with an <hi>Oath</hi> ſo to do. If <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> be ſinful then we are bound againſt it antecedently to our Oath,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:95586:70"/> and whether we had abjured it or no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. And if you think <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> thus unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, you ſhould not ſo much decry it upon the account of the <hi>Covenant;</hi> but becauſe it is in it ſelf ſinful, as contrary to ſome Divine, or Apoſtolical war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: although it's true a ſupervenient Oath makes an Obligation againſt a thing in it ſelf ſinful, ſo much the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. But as I told you before, the ableſt Champions for <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> have not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to aſſert <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> unlawful, as being contrary to any Divine, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical warrant. If it be indifferent, that is, neither commanded nor forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or lawful but not neceſſary, but left to Chriſtian prudence: Then the queſtion will be, if we could by our Oath make it abſolutely, and in every caſe unlawful to our ſelves, ſo that we can never in any caſe after, own or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it. You are miſtaken, if you think an Oath againſt the uſe of a thing in different, ſo binds, that in no caſe after, the ſwearer can lawfully uſe that thing. <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> ſay, an Oath taken about an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different thing, may in ſome caſes ceaſe to bind (we now ſuppone <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95586:70"/> be in it ſelf indifferent) if the thing ſworn againſt be a matter, wherein our Superiours have power to command us, They by their authority given them of God, may require obedience from us in any thing lawful; and ſo in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, they may command us to do or uſe that which we have ſworn againſt, it being a thing in it ſelf lawful: and in this caſe our Oath ceaſes to bind. 2. If af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have ſworn, there come to be ſuch an alteration in the State of affairs, that what was lawfully promiſed, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now be lawfully performed; In this eaſe the Oath ceaſes to bind, <hi>Si res non permanent in eodem ſtatu,</hi> ſay Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, <hi>ceſſat juramenti obligatio.</hi> Or 3. When our Oath comes to be <hi>Impeditivum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joris boni,</hi> that is, <hi>a hinderance to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er good,</hi> if we ſtill ſtand to what we have ſworn. In ſuch caſes as theſe the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of an Oath about a matter in it ſelf not ſinful, ceaſes to bind: as Caſuiſts commonly teach, and the Author of the <hi>Seaſonable Caſe;</hi> and of the <hi>Survey of Naphtaly</hi> at length applyes to the Oath of the <hi>Covenant</hi> abjuring <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and ſhews, that upon ſuppoſition of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs

                     <hi>To what you ſay of the firſt caſe, in which a promiſſory Oath about a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, may ceaſe to bind,</hi> viz. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Superiours interveening: <hi>you would do well to conſider that the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Oath is a very Sacred Bond, and I think it's hard to ſay, that the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any man can looſe the Oath of God; In that caſe we ſhould ſay,</hi> We have open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our mouth to the Lord, and cannot go back.</p>

                  <p>And do you think that by your Oath you can warrantably bind your ſelf up from obeying the Law of God in the fifth <hi>Commandment,</hi> and in many other expreſs Scriptures, that biddeth you <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and obey your Superiours.</hi> I told you that the Law of God enjoyning obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Superiours layes the firſt and greateſt obligation upon you. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, conſider what a door you would open to fruſtrate <hi>Superiours</hi> of all that obedience, which <hi>Inferiours</hi> owe to them: for when theſe in Authority ſhall require obedience of their Subjects in ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, they may anſwer, hold us excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, we cannot obey you, for we have ſworn not to do this thing. And if we may thus warrantably ſhift in one thing, why not in another thing? And ſo may by our <hi>Oaths</hi> pre-limite and bind up our ſelves from obeying any thing, which thoſe in Authority can require of us. And thus you may ſee, whether that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of yours tends, even to caſt off the Yoke of all Obedience and Subjection, which the Lord ſo expreſly in his Word hath laid upon the necks of Subjects. Read the 30. <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Numbers.</hi> and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95586:72"/> there you will ſee, that if the Wife, or the Daughter in the Fathers Houſeſhould bind themſelves by a Vow, the Huſband or Parent had power to anul and make it void: and by proportion and analogie, the King who is <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> hath the ſame power over us.</p>

                  <p>Read the 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> of that 30. of <hi>Numbers,</hi> where you find that even after the Husband hath heard, and by his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence confirmed the Wifes vow (of which was ſpoken, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12.) he hath notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of his tacite confirmation, ſtill a power of anulling and making void her Vow; and if he do ſo, ſhe is bound to yield to her Husbands commands, and is exonered of her Vow. Indeed if the Husband (the like may be ſaid of the Parent) do thus without good ground, irritate and make void the Wifes Vow, he is culpable, <hi>he ſhall bear her ſin,</hi> but
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:95586:73"/> ſhe is free, becauſe bound to obey her Husband, as being under a prior obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of obedience unto him by the Law of God. You may conſult Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters on that 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> of <hi>Numbers</hi> 30. and ſhall find them expounding it of the Husbands voiding his Wifes Vows, even after he had confirmed them, and if he do ſo, <hi>he ſhall bear her ſin:</hi> that is, ſay ſome, If there be a guilt here it ſhall lye one the Husband who made the Vow void, not on the Wife, who by a prior obligation was bound to obey her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and which her poſterior Vow could never free her of. Others expone theſe words, <hi>he ſhall bear her ſin,</hi> thus, <hi>he ſhall take away her ſin:</hi> Now the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band may take away the Wifes ſin, ſhe doing but her duty in obeying him; and yet he may be guiltleſs too, if he revock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his former confirmation upon juſt and rational grounds. And as to the Wifes part, ſome Interpreters ſay, <hi>Mariti au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritas uxorem abſolvit voto &amp; culpa,</hi> That is, the authority of the Huſband abſolves the Wife of her vow and ſin too.

                  <p>I confeſs, I wonder much you ſhould make uſe of this argument in the manner you do to prove the obligation of your Oath againſt <hi>Biſhops:</hi> for that place is quite miſtaken by you. Therefore firſt. If you think <hi>Joſhua</hi> was forbidden to make peace at all with any of the <hi>Canaanits</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any terms, but was to root them all out; and yet becauſe of his Oath he ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Gibeonits,</hi> though it was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to an expreſs command of God; you run your ſelf into a moſt wild and groſs opinion that can not be admitted, <hi>viz.</hi> That an Oath can bind againſt a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, whether it be a Moral, or particular Command, it is all one. And ſo as before you aſſerted an Oath to bind againſt the command of men in Authority; Now you go a greater length in ſaying an Oath bindeth againſt the more immediate Command of God. What man of ſound judgement will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the firſt, much leſs the ſecond. 2. You
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95586:76"/> are in a miſtake if you think <hi>Joſhua</hi> had no warrant to make peace with any of the <hi>Canaanits,</hi> but was commanded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as once treating with them, to root them all out. For <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 10. He is commanded to <hi>proclaim peace to any City</hi> indefinitely he came to fight againſt, the <hi>Canaanits</hi> not excepted, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with this difference; 1. No Peace was to be concluded with any of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanits,</hi> unleſs they became ſervants, and yielded up their Lands, which the Lord had beſtowed upon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the true Religion, abandoning their <hi>heatheniſh Idolatries:</hi> And hence ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>Leagues</hi> are diſcharged to be made with them, they reſerving their <hi>heatheniſh Worſhip,</hi> leſt they ſhould draw away the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the true God. 2. If any City of the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nits</hi> did refuſe peace, (for there is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt a meer <hi>Peace</hi> and a <hi>League,</hi> as ſome have obſerved; and that <hi>Joſhua</hi> at the firſt, made a <hi>League</hi> with the <hi>Gibeonits,</hi> but as ſoon as he knew them to be <hi>Canaanits</hi> he breaketh the <hi>League</hi> as being contrary to the Command of God, and meerly alloweth them a <hi>peace,

Which otherwiſe had not been lawful for them to do. And from <hi>Joſh.</hi> 11. <hi>verſ.</hi> 19, 20. Which place clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhews, that if other Cities of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanits</hi> had ſubmitted; as <hi>Gibeon</hi> did, <hi>Joſhua</hi> might have ſpared them.

I ſay, <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the <hi>Princes</hi> by that Oath did ſwear nothing contrary to the Command of God, but their Oath was conſonant to Gods Command, that upon ſuch and ſuch terms they might have peace, ſo that <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the <hi>Princes</hi> were bound to ſpare them, although they had not ſworn. And, 4. The Lord was angry
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:95586:77"/> with <hi>Saul</hi> for ſlaying the <hi>Gibeonits,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was contrary both to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, in giving them peace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſubmiſſion, and alſo to <hi>Joſhua's</hi> Oath made to their Fathers: and not meerly becauſe it was contrary to the Oath, as you much miſtake, when you think it did bind contrary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God. You may conſult the <hi>Criticks,</hi> and other <hi>Interpreters,</hi> collected by Mr <hi>Pool,</hi> as alſo others, on <hi>Joſhua</hi> 9.18. The <hi>Engliſh Annotations</hi> on <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. &amp;c. And you ſhall find that ſome indeed are of the opinion, that <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the <hi>Princes</hi> were diſcharged to make any peace at all with any of the <hi>Canaanits</hi> (though herein they are oppoſed both by the moſt judicious and numerous) yet thoſe who think that <hi>Joſhua</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to make no peace with them, whom herein you follow, ſay not, that <hi>Joſhua</hi> after he diſcovered the <hi>Gibeonits</hi> to be of the <hi>Canaanits,</hi> was bound to ſtand to his Oath (as ye ſay) It being contrary to an expreſs Command of God: but they ſay <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the <hi>Princes</hi> Oath did not bind.

                     </gap> ſo much diſpleaſed, as a great argument for you. To which briefly, I ſay, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Zedekiah</hi> held the Crown of <hi>Nebuchadne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> and that the Lord by the Prophet had expreſly commanded him and the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſubmit to the King of <hi>Babylon, Jer.</hi> 27. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9, 12.

It's clear, <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was oblieged to have done ſo according to Gods Command, whatever he could pretend to the contrary.

Now to what you ſay of an edifying Gift, I wiſh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you miſtake it not, if a man have a ſtentorian voice, or a ton, can ſpeak loud and boldly, and can rail upon the Civil Powers, and cry down <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>Curats:</hi> O, <hi>that is an edifying man!</hi> It feareth me, many of you who are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders high enough to knowledge, and piety, can little judge of mens Gifts when all is done: and I make no doubt, oft times leaves better at home then what ye go to. But paſſing this, I offer to your ſerious conſideration theſe few things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent the diverſe meaſures of Miniſterial Gifts, and Edification by them. 1. The Lord hath not given to all Miniſters alike mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Gifts, but the Spirit diſtributes in what meaſure he pleaſeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and therefore to undervalue men of low Gifts, is to quarrel with the Almighty. 2. Though all have not received alike meaſure, we muſt not therefore think the meaneſt Gifts are uſeleſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>verſ.</hi> 21.25. 3. The beſt Gifts can not of themſelves work on hearts and conſciences, it's on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Spirit can do this by what means
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:95586:88"/> pleaſeteh him, weak or ſtrong, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7. And therefore peoples too much magnifying of Cifts is but an idoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of men, and giving Gods due to the Creature, this ſeems to have been the fault of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor. chap.</hi> 1. and <hi>chap.</hi> 3. The learned <hi>Hieronimus Zauchius</hi> in the <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatory to the ſeventh</hi> Tom. <hi>of his Works,</hi> tells, that when firſt he left <hi>Italy,</hi> he came to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neve,</hi> and there obſerving a <hi>French</hi> man who uſed always to hear <hi>Calvin,</hi> and none elſe, he asked him his reaſon why he did not hear <hi>Viretus</hi> as occaſion ſerved, he anſwered, that if <hi>Paul</hi> were to come and preach at <hi>Geneve, Ego relicto Paulo, audirem Calvinum,</hi> i. e. he would leave <hi>Paul</hi> and go hear <hi>Calvin;</hi> which anſwer amazed <hi>Zauchius,</hi> and ſaith that he heard him, <hi>cum ſumma animi offenſione,</hi> i. e. <hi>Zau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi> was much troubled and offended at his anſwer, and obſerveth from it, how dangerous it is for people to admire any Miniſter too much, and make gods of them, as he ſaith, and to deſpiſe others. 4. The Lord uſeth oft-times to do more good by men of weak Gifts, than by greater. <hi>Chriſt</hi> was very far beyond <hi>Peter</hi>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:95586:89"/> in Gifts, for <hi>he received not the Spirit in meaſure,</hi> and his enemies did bear him witneſs, that <hi>never man ſpake like him.</hi> And in another place, <hi>They wondered at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth;</hi> And yet <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>Peter</hi> a poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man, and very weakly gifted in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Chriſt, at one Sermon convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth three thouſand. We read no where of the like ſucceſs of Chriſts Miniſtry, but we hear him oft complaining of ſmal ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, as was before propheſied, <hi>Iſai</hi> 49. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. and <hi>Chap,</hi> 53. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2, 3. &amp;c. And in the Goſpel frequently upbraiding theſe to whom he had preached, becauſe of their unbelief, <hi>Math.</hi> 11. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20, 21, 22, 23. &amp;c. <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, 15. &amp;c. <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. <hi>verſ.</hi> 37. <hi>John.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 40. and in other places. And in that famous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon he had on the Mount, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6, 7. It's ſaid <hi>Chap. verſ.</hi> 28. that when he had ended his Sermon, <hi>the people were aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed,</hi> but not a word that many were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, but ground for the contrary, from <hi>Chap</hi> 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10, 11, 12. where commending the <hi>Centurion's</hi> faith, he ſaith to the multitude that followed him down from the Mount, That many ſhould
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:95586:89"/> come from the <hi>Eaſt and Weſt</hi> and ſit down with <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. And the unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jews,</hi> who were the children of the Kingdom, ſhould be caſt out. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I ſay, if people would in one or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly way, attend the Ordinances in their own congregations, and would lay aſide prejudices, and pray that the Gifts of their own Miniſters may be bleſſed to them; they might expect it ſhould not be in vain, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>We have this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in earthen veſſels that the excellency,</hi> &amp;c. And ſurely the more weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient the Inſtrument is, the more is his Omnipotency conſpicuous, and his Arm revealed in doing good by weak means.

                  <p>I ſpake ſomewhat before of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation we are under to maintain the Churches Peace, and of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Church in ancient times, and in our own times to this purpoſe. And now further, do you not know that there is a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal obligation betwixt a Miniſter and his People, which can not be ſo eaſily bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as you imagine. As the Miniſter is oblieged to labour among the people of his charge, diligently and faithfully, and that upon his peril, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. So the people of his charge are bound to attend on his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry among them. To eſteem him high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and love him for his Works ſake, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 11, 12. To obey him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. Now how obey ye theſe injunctions when ye turn your backs upon your Miniſters, will not receive the Law from their mouth, but do undervalue, deſpiſe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance, diſcourage, and weaken their hands by this your contempt, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:95586:90"/> by your reproaches too, which oft ye are pleaſed to caſt upon them? Do ye not fear what Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>He that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth me?</hi> Hear I pray you what Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> (whoſe teſtimony I think ye ought to regard) ſaith, he ſpeaking of a Miniſters relation to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregation, on <hi>Revel. Pag.</hi> 105, 106. After he hath ſhewed that there is warrant from thoſe <hi>Epiſtles</hi> directed to the <hi>Angels</hi> of the ſeven Churches, for a more ſpecial relation betwixt a <hi>Miniſter</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Flock,</hi> rather than another <hi>Flock,</hi> and betwixt a <hi>Flock</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> rather than another <hi>Minister:</hi> for the <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was not the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> nor yet the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> equally bound to the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> as to the <hi>Angel of Epheſus,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:95586:91"/> to that Miniſter from which, according to his appointment there ariſeth a mutual obligation betwixt ſuch a</hi> Miniſter <hi>and ſuch a</hi> people; <hi>he is bound to Miniſter to them in the Goſpel, and they are bound to ſubmit to him, ſtrengthen him, acknowledge him, communicate to him in all good things,</hi> &amp;c. And further, he there ſhews, that this Obligation is not founded <hi>upon meer vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntar conſent, but on theſe Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>Galat.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. and the like; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be no explicite covenanting betwixt a <hi>Miniſter</hi> and a <hi>People</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to theſe ends. And, <hi>pag.</hi> 106. he ſaith, <hi>From this mutual obligation there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth a nearer ſympathy betwixt that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and People, than betwixt him and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other People, and betwixt them and that Miniſter, than betwixt them and any other Miniſter: They have common intereſts, common hazards, common joy and grief: and a croſs to one ſhould be to both. And a little after he addeth, that there are peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar duties called for on both ſides to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which are not ſo required betwixt them and others; and that there will be a peculiar reckoning that will follow hereupon;

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:95586:92"/> by the Greek word, and not the people. Now you will not ſay, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> did elect Miniſters to theſe Churches, that were to yield the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Therefore in our Tranſlation it is ſaid, when they, that is, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> had ordained them Elders in every Church, they prayed and commended them to the Lord. Now all theſe were the actions of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> not of the people. And, 3. If you mean by this Word, the peoples electing Miniſters by ſuffrages, you loſe by it, and gives great advantage to Independents, who are for popular elections of Miniſters: Whereas ye give this power, not to all the people, but to the <hi>Seſſion:</hi> And therefore obſerving Preſbyterians have forborn to preſs this place, as you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it. But, 2. If you think the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters election either by People or Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eſſential, that is, ſo neceſſary to make one a Miniſter to ſuch a people, that he cannot be their Miniſter without it, you by this do not only nullify the Miniſtry of almoſt the whole Chriſtian World for above a thouſand years upward, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in particular, the Miniſtry of this
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:95586:93"/> Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ever until the year 1649. for not till then were <hi>Patronages</hi> taken away, and the election by <hi>Seſſions</hi> brought in uſe. Now what thanks will you get for this, even from many of your ſelves? For not only were all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Miniſters before the year 1638. entered by Preſentations, but alſo all the Preſbyterian Miniſters after the year, 1638. till the year 1649. And there are ſome of them ſtill in Office at this day in the ſame Congregations, to which they entered, not by the Seſſions election, but by the Patrons Preſentation: yet I think none of you will ſcruple to hear or own them upon that account, nor ever did.</p>

                  <p>Yet all the Miniſters whom ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to hear were not ordained by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, even all who were ordained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the year 1638. and 1662. or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and there are very many of theſe at this day in this Church, whom ye will not hear, though they were ordained by a <hi>Presbytrie</hi> without a <hi>Biſhop.</hi> As for your not hearing of ſuch as received Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination from a Biſhop, ye would for the ſame reaſon have refuſed to hear thoſe miniſters whom <hi>Timothy</hi> ordained in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. or whom <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> ordained in <hi>Crete, Tit.</hi> 1.5. You may ſee what <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith on the place. And ye would have refuſed to hear any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in the World for many hundreds of years together, for all were ordained by Biſhops. It was early ſaid in the Church, <hi>Quid facit Epiſcopus quod non fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit Presbyter, excepta Ordinatione.</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, then was accounted the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:95586:94"/> act of the Biſhop, and now Biſhops ordain not without the concurrence of Miniſters, who alſo have a hand in that action. And by this reaſon of yours ye would have refuſed to hear thoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters who were the Members of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> 1638. For though they voted down the Biſhops, yet all of them generally had been ordained by Biſhops, few or none excepted, and had ſworn obedience to them too. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by this reaſon ye ſhould refuſe to hear ſome at this day, who though they do not conform now to Epiſcopacy: yet were ordained by Biſhops before the year 1638. and without ſcruple ye can hear ſuch of the validity of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Biſhops, ſee at length the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Preſbyterians in their <hi>Jus Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Miniſterij Anglicani,</hi> from <hi>Pag.</hi> 17. eſpecially from <hi>pag.</hi> 25. to <hi>pag.</hi> 32. or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if you will to <hi>pag.</hi> 49.</p>

For as all ye who uſe that word, uſeth to expreſs your ſpleen and diſdain, not fearing Chriſts word, <hi>be that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth me:</hi> So there be very few among you who know what the word, <hi>Curate,</hi> ſignifieth: And even thoſe who know that it ſignifieth one who hath, <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram animarum,</hi> the care of ſouls (a name no Miniſter needs be aſhamed of, but ſhould ſtrive to be in ſome meaſure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to it) yet I ſuppoſe, know not well, many of them, how, or in what ſenſe it hath been uſed, elſe they would not ſo ignorantly miſapply it: For thoſe uſe to be called, <hi>Curats,</hi> who ſerve the Cure, as they ſpeak, though they be not the Miniſters who are preſented to the place, but ſubſtituted by them to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiat in their room, and hence are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Curats,</hi> the preſented Miniſter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none reſident.

I know no Biſhop who hath ſuch thoughts of himſelf, or of Miniſters, what ever ye think or ſay to caſt an <hi>odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> upon them.

                  <p>All who preach under the preſent Government, yea, I ſuppoſe the moſt part of them, never took the Covenant, and therefore are not to be called <hi>perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> For I told you at our laſt confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the Covenant, as ſuch cannot bind them who never took it, and ſo ſuch Miniſters may be heard, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this reaſon, and even thoſe Miniſters who took the Covenant, and now upon this alteration continue in their Miniſtry under Biſhops, are not perjured (ſuppoſe our Epiſcopacy be meant in the Covenant) for the reaſons I gave you at our laſt communing. An Oath made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:95586:95"/> a thing in it ſelf not unlawful, can not bind abſolutely or in every caſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when it's taken, is neceſſarily to be underſtood with certain limitations and reſtrictions; otherwiſe it may come to be a bond of iniquity, as this Oath, may be, is to many through their miſtake hereof. But giving though not granting, that all the Miniſters who took the Covenant, and now preach under Biſhops, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, it will be hard for you to prove, That therefore they are not to be owned as truly Miniſters of the Goſpel, nor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to. It is true, perſonal faults and vices make a Miniſter juſtly liable to Church cenſure; and if they be of a high ſcandalous nature, to depoſition; eſpecially if he be impenitent in them: But ſo long as he is not convict and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, the queſtion is, whither or not the people may, yea, and ought to wait on his Miniſtry? You know <hi>Judas</hi> was ſent forth to preach with the reſt by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt himſelf, and who will ſay that it was unwarrantable for any to hear him who came cloathed with ſuch a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and commiſſion from Chriſt, as long as he was not convict, even though
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:95586:96"/> they had known what a knave he was, for Chriſt knew very well what he was. And ye know what great exceptions might have been brought, both againſt the Life and Doctrine of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees, Mat.</hi> 15.23. and in other places. They were moſt bitter active enemies againſt Chriſt the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> by all means ſought to undo him, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected the weightie duties of the Law, ſuch as <hi>Mercy, Judgement,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> were full of Pride and groſs hypocriſie: I will not inſiſt to tell you how <hi>Naphta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> in a great diſtemper, miſcalls the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the time very ill: though much were true of what he ſaith, as God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, yet they would be no worſe than the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> yea, not ſo ill; for they did moſt maliciouſly oppoſe Chriſt Jeſus himſelf, and that directly: neither have I any pleaſure to make that parallel betwixt the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and your <hi>Preachers,</hi> ye ſo much glory of, that ſome have done, in their <hi>long prayers, devouring of widows houſes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing Sea and Land to make Proſelits,</hi> &amp;c. They have given but too much ground for theſe compariſons. But to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:95586:96"/> our purpoſe, as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> were very groſs in their lives, ſo there was much Leaven in their Doctrine, they brought in a number of humane Traditions into the Doctrine and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God and taught for <hi>Doctrines the commandments of men, they took away the Key of Knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt in his Sermon on the Mount, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. purges the Law from their corrupt gloſſes: and yet for all this, <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> two old Saints, did not forſake the Temple, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. Nor turned <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> though it was turned into a den of thieves. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> went up yearly to the Temple to keep the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> and Chriſt himſelf went with them at twelve years of age. And <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. He biddeth hear the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> who ſat in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair, notwithſtanding their bad lives, and corrupt Doctrines, only he gives a <hi>Caveat,</hi> to bewar of their Leaven, and their ill example: Read Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> on <hi>Revel. Chap.</hi> 3. Commenting on the Epiſtle to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of <hi>Sardis,</hi> who had a <hi>name that he lived, but was dead, Pag.</hi> 187. He ſaith, that comparing that Angel with him of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:95586:97"/> 
                     <hi>Laodicea, There is ground to ſay that men who are for their own caſe unſound, may yet be Miniſters in the Church of Chriſt, and ought to be eſteemed ſo, while they continue in that room; ſeing Chriſt doth ſo here.</hi> And again, ſaith, <hi>The Ordinance of Chriſt ought not to ſuffer derogation in whatſoever hands it be; And that hence the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends to his hearers to give due Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial reſpect to the Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> Mat. 23. <hi>Even when he is about to diſcover their rottenneſs, and that</hi> Judas <hi>was by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be accounted an Ambaſſadour of Chriſt with the reſt, becauſe it is not grace that intituleth one to that charge, but Chriſts Call and Commiſſion; And ſeing a call may be ſeparated from grace, as grace from a call, it will follow, that according to his Soveraignity he may make uſe of whom he will, he may make uſe of men even more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than others, that it may be known that edifying of ſouls doth not neceſſarily depend on the holineſs of the Inſtrument,</hi> Act. 3.12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.23. Thus Mr. <hi>Durham.</hi> Now how can you juſtifie your <hi>Separation,</hi> when you dare not with any face ſay the Miniſters of the time are as corrupt as were the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> if there

It's ſaid, ſome of them are ſo far tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to threaten people with damnation if they hear the <hi>Curats</hi> (ſo they call Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters) how true this is, I will not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively ſay, the matter reported being ſo groſs, renders it hardly credible: What truth may be in it you know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than I. You ſay <hi>Chriſt biddeth not hear the Scribes and Phariſees;</hi> yet I told you, Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> ſaith, Chriſt there recommends to the people to give due Miniſterial reſpect to the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees:</hi> Now is not hearing of them a part of <hi>due miniſterial reſpect,</hi> think you?
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:95586:98"/> Certainly without this their <hi>miniſterial reſpect</hi> ſhould be very lame. Chriſt bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the people obſerve and do what the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> from <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair enjoyned them to obſerve and do, and how could they obey Chriſts injunction in this, unleſs they heard the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> teach them thoſe things from <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair. He that biddeth me obey my Miniſters Doctrine delivered to me from the Word of God, his injunction carrieth alſo in it, an injunction to hear the Miniſter deliver thoſe Doctrins to me, or preſuppoſeth my hearing as the ordinary mean, or antecedent of my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. Be pleaſed to conſult Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters on the place, and you will find them generally expounding that place, both of hearing and obeying. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is too clear a Scripture for you to elude, but will ſtand againſt you to your great conviction. <hi>Brouniſts</hi> and ſuch like <hi>Separatists</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> time, and ſince, found the dint of it from the old non-conformiſts, who diſputed againſt their dividing practices, which ye ſo much follow.</p>

                     <hi>It may be ſo. Yet many Epiſcopal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:95586:98"/> have entered in upon honeſt mens la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: and for this reaſon ought not to be heard, but diſcountenanced as Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>

                  <p>All the Epiſcopal Miniſters entered not ſo, very many of them kept ſtill the places the change of Government found them in: Others entered unto Churches upon the vacancies by the death of thoſe who had been there before, or upon their tranſportation to ſome other Church. You muſt confeſs this reaſon ſayeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt any of thoſe. Yet you ſay, <hi>many Epiſcopal Miniſters did intrude themſelves upon other mens labours.</hi> If here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you mean a <hi>ſinful intruſion,</hi> as I know you do, let me ask you, firſt, were theſe Miniſters whom you charge with <hi>Intruſion</hi> active in outing their Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, or did they come in upon their places till they were out, and their places declared vacant? 2. Would you, or would theſe Miniſters who were not clear to keep their places on the terms of the change, but choſed rather to ſtep out, have the people of ſuch Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations left without a ſettled Miniſtrie, becauſe they were not clear to brook
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:95586:99"/> it themſelves? Is this all their kindneſs to their people, or looks it not rather like a piece of petted ſelf, that will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do nor let do? And what you talk of coming in upon other mens la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, is as applicable to one that cometh in upon a Miniſters charge, who againſt his will is tranſported to another charge, by thoſe who have power to diſpoſe of him: The Miniſter ſo tranſported, may be, thinketh there is a wrong done both to him, and to the people he is taken from, and the people think ſo too; and poſſibly it is ſo: yet he who ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him upon an orderly and fair call, you know, cannot be ſaid to be an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder,</hi> or in your ſenſe, to come in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another mans labours. I think an injury, ſuppoſe really done to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Miniſter, by thoſe who put him to the door, ought not hinder well advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed people from ſubmitting to another, for there is a neceſſity of a Miniſtrie, and knowing conſciencious Chriſtians ſhould make the beſt of what they can not help in their Superiours. And if they cannot get ſuch a Miniſter as they would, ought to take ſuch as they can

Theſe Miniſters who were put from their charges, for aſſerting their duty to the King in the year 1648. had far better ground to complain that others were brought in upon their labours: yet they were ſilent and ſubmiſſive, nor did they ſtir up the people to diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſuch as ſucceeded in their places: and if the people had withdrawn, and refuſed to hear them that ſucceded, as <hi>Intruders,</hi> as people are taught now to do, without doubt, the <hi>Judicatours</hi> at that time would have noticed them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely.

In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. The Apoſtle is ſpeaking of the dutie of Chriſtians in Separating from Idolaters, and Heathens in their
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:95586:102"/> Idolatries and ungodlie fellowſhips, not of withdrawing from Chriſtian Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. and 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6.

                     <hi>We think we have better reaſon to charge you with</hi> Schiſm, <hi>than ye have to charge us; for ye have departed from the Government of this Church by Presbytrie, to which we still adhere: ſo that ye

                  <p>What, little ground ye have to charge us with Schiſm in reſpect of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, may appear, if ye conſider, 1. That our ſumbitting to the preſent Government by Biſhops, is in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Commands, of our Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, whom both ye and we are bound to obey in things in themſelves not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: So that our ſubmiſſion is dutie, and your non-ſubmiſſion is both diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Schiſm, diſobedience to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, Schiſm from the body of the Church. 2 If ye will conſider, that Epiſcopacy (as at ſome length I ſhew in our firſt conference) is the only Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church left by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and practiſed in the firſt and pureſt times after them, and ſo downward: Not we who now ſubmit to this Government are the Schiſmaticks, but ye who refuſe ſubmiſſion to it; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ye are guilty of Schiſm from the whole Primitive times, alſwell as from us. But beſides, when we charge you with Schiſm, we mean it not only, nor mainly of Schiſm, in reſpect of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:95586:103"/> but of your dividing and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from our Chriſtian Aſſemblies eſpecially, and Divine Worſhip there performed; which indeed is a great Schiſm, even ſuppoſe there were many things wrong among us, that needed amendment, I pray you conſider, I hope ye will not ſay, we have departed more from you and from the truth, than the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church under them had departed from <hi>Moſes</hi> Law in Chriſts time, and yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt nor the godly at that time, ſuch as <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna, Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, thought themſelves oblieged to ſeparate from that Church.

                  <p>Some among us did continue to Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, but that did not keep the people from the diſeaſe of the time, <hi>Separation.</hi> 2. We have the Scriptures publickly read in the Church, which is a very ancient practice, both in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Church. The <hi>Jews</hi> had the five Books
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:95586:103"/> of <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Pentatuch,</hi> which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Law, divided into 53. Sections by <hi>Ezra,</hi> as ſome think, and every Sabbath day one of thoſe Sections, together with a part of the Prophets was read in the Synagogues, See <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> 15, 27. and <hi>Act.</hi> 15.21. And that there were Lectures, that is, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the ancient Chriſtian Church, is well known. So that ye who on this ground Separate now, would have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the Church in all ages. 3. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures as now uſed, have no authority from the Church nor ever had: For they are not according to the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, which was, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhould read a Chapter in the Old Teſtament, and another in the New, and where any difficult place occurred, briefly give the meaning without any more, but that way was ſoon left, and Miniſters held with one Chapter, and many with a part of one, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expounded, but alſo raiſed practical obſervations: ſo that in effect, as ſome have expreſſed it, the Lecture came to be a ſhort Sermon on a long Text: And indeed a Lecture and a Sermon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:95586:104"/> it, are two Sermons at one dyet, and they that ſeparate for want of this, would for the ſame reaſon ſeparate from one who uſeth ſhorter Sermons, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother who preacheth longer: And yet long tedious Sermons are judged leſs edifying, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> and it may be a queſtion whither it be not fitter for peoples edification to hold them with one Sermon at one dyet, than to give them two, conſidering their forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when a great variety of purpoſes is accumulat, one thing puts out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And conſidering their dulneſs, and backwardneſs to receive divine things, and how ſoon corrupt nature will wearie and ſit up, when about theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes; is it not ſafer to hold with a few things, and preſs them home at one time? Therefore that ancient Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Pembo,</hi> an unlearned man, recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Church Hiſtorie, deſiring ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to learn him a part of a <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and having heard the firſt <hi>verſe</hi> of the 39. <hi>Pſalm</hi> read, would hear no more, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was a leſſon great enough at that time, and a long time after that another asked him, if he was yet ready for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:95586:104"/> leſſon, he anſwered no, for he had not ſufficiently learned his firſt leſſon. 4. Suppoſe our want of Lectures were a fault, yet I told you every fault or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect in a Church is not a ground to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from her. And know you not that the ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church ſome times wanted Ordinances even of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution, and that for a long time together, as <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> the <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</hi> &amp;c. And will any ſay, ſhe ought therefore to have been Separated from. 5. On this ground of yours ye would ſeparate from all the Proteſtant Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in the World at this day; in none of which ye will find a Lecture: Yea, ye would have ſeparate from the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ever till about the year, 1645. for till then we had no Lectures. I could wiſh indeed all our Sermons were more like Lectures, as Lectures have been, and are by ſome uſed, that is, that Miniſters would take long Texts, and reduce them into ſome few points, eſpecially inſiſting on the Scope, as is uſual in Churches abroad, I make no doubt, people would pleaſe this way better, and retain more of what is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:95586:105"/> than when Miniſters confine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſhort Texts, and then too oft rack both the Text, and their own Brains, ſeeking matter to hold out the time with. But herein I only give my own judgement.</p>

                     <hi>There is another thing yet keepeth me back from joining with you in your Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies for Divine worſhip: If I ſhould joyn with you, many good people would be offended, who look upon hearing among you to be a ſin: and the Apoſtle ſaith, we muſt not give offence, nor lay a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block before others.</hi>

                  <p>When the word forbiddeth us to give offence; Firſt, it is meant of not doing that before others which is in it ſelf ſinful, whereby we indeed offend or grieve the godly, as alſo, lay a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block in the way of others by our ill example: Now when you do your duty in obeying God, you cannot be ſaid to give offence unto any: And if any will be offended at you, it's their own ſin and weakneſs, for they take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence where none is given, and in the preſent caſe if any will be offended at you for your maintaining unity and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:95586:105"/> peace in the Church, and for not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the aſſembling of your ſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the reſt of his people; It's their own weakneſs while you give them no Offence at all, but on the contrary, by your good example is in a holy way provoking them to their duty with you: and if you ſhall ly by for fear of their offence, you ſhall both omit your own duty, and harden them in their ſin. 2. Ordinarily where the Apoſtle for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth Chriſtians to give offence to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he is ſhewing how they ought to uſe their Chriſtian liberty in things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different: That they muſt not uſe it to the offence of their weak brother; when either thereby he ſhall contrary to his conſcience be emboldened to ſin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10. or yet ſhould be grieved with us becauſe he thinks we ſin in doing what he conceives we ſhould not, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>verſe.</hi> 15. Yet you muſt know if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Authority interpoſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn me to uſe a thing in it ſelf indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, or not uſe it; then and in that caſe it's no more indifferent to me as to that particular and time, my liberty, <hi>pro tunc,</hi> is determined and reſtricted by
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:95586:106"/> Authority; and the thing though in it's own nature indifferent ſtill, is by the ſupervenient command of Authority made neceſſary to me in my uſing, or not uſing it, according as Authority hath determined, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. <hi>Theſe neceſſary things.</hi> though ſome of theſe things were not neceſſary in themſelves, yet abſtaining from them was at that time made neceſſary by the Authority of that Council, for the good of the Church. Then and in ſuch a caſe as this, my obedience to Authority will prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derat the other of not giving offence, the firſt being the greater duty of the two, as <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Caſuists</hi> ſhew. And even in this caſe I give no offence, but do my duty, and if any take offence, it's cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs on my part, and is occaſioned through my brothers weakneſs. It is <hi>Scandalum acceptum non datum,</hi> Scandel groundleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken by him, not at all given by me. When the Apoſtle forbiddeth Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to uſe their liberty to the offence of the weak, he ſpeaketh to thoſe who were not determined by Authority. Have you any more to ſay for your Schiſm?</p>

                  <p>It's true, Chriſt preached in houſes, and in the fields, and people heard. But did he ſo upon ſuch grounds as ye do, to wit, that he might ſeparate and teach people to ſeparate from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church: Or did he either think or teach that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> teachers at that time ought not to be heard? I trow not. He was oft in the Temple, and in the Synagogues, he allowed of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> only with this <hi>proviſo,</hi> to beware of their lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:95586:107"/> and bad lives, ſome whom he mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſlie healed, he ſent to the Prieſts to offer their Offering according to the Law, and did not bid people decline or diſown them, for as corrupt as they were. But ye on the contrary erect mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of your own, becauſe ye think ours unlawful to join with. But further, Chriſt preached in any place. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was about the bringing in of the Goſpel Doctrine into the World, and of Preaching himſelf the true <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> which was neceſſarie to be done, and therefore took all occaſions for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in anie place, and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the oppoſition this Doctrine, (though in it ſelf moſt neceſſarie) met with from the Jewiſh teachers. And 2. Chriſt was the head of the whole Church, and therefore was not to be limited in the waie and manner of his Miniſtrie, as other Teachers ought and muſt be, but might Preach, when, and where, and to whom he pleaſed, for all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to his Miniſtrie, and I know none in the World will ſay, that he is univerſal Paſtor of the whole Church, except the <hi>Pope:</hi> Nor will any ſay that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:95586:107"/> it is warrantable for meer men to do what Chriſt did in everie thing. Theſe meetings of yours ye hold and frequent in deſpight of the Laws of the Land, which are verie expreſs againſt them. And ſo to Schiſm ye add diſobedience to the Civil Powers.</p>

                  <p>The Laws of the Land hinder not, but allow and command you to hear the Word of God in your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, where ye have the Goſpel purelie preached by the allowance, and under the defence of Authoritie, a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie ye too little value. Is it not better to Worſhip God in a way not contrarie to the Law of the Land, the Law allowing me to Worſhip him purelie, than in a waie that is contrarie to the Law, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with diſobedience to it. As for what you bring out of <hi>Act.</hi> 4.19. From the Apoſtles their not obeying the Council of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> diſcharging them to ſpeak at all, or teach in the Name of Jeſus,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:95586:108"/> it doth no waie quadrat with your caſe. For <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Apoſtles had an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate extraordinarie call from Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to Preach in his Name, and ſo were not to be diſcharged by anie Power on Earth. 2. The Prohibition given to them was intended to ſuppreſs the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel abſolutelie, and as ſuch, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was not lawful for them to obeie: Nor was there anie other viſible waie to propagate the Goſpel through the World, but by their Preaching. But among us, though ſome Miniſters be ſilent, there are manie others not diſcharged, but allowed to Preach. And, bleſt be God, the oppoſition of Authoritie is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Goſpel it ſelf, but againſt your diſorders.</p>

                  <p>You now give me occaſion to tell you brieflie how your Preachers behave themſelves in this Schiſm, who are indeed the great propagators of it. 1. They exerce their Miniſtrie contrarie to the Command of Authoritie; concerning which you ask, whether the King and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:95586:108"/> the Law can ſilence a Miniſter, that he may not preach the Word of God. To which, I ſay, you read of <hi>Solomons</hi> thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out <hi>Abiathar</hi> from the Prieſt-hood, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.27. That it was a depoſing of him ſimply from all Prieſtly power. I ſhall not debate, yet ſure it was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining of his Prieſtly power as to the actual exercing, and officiating, which he was bound to ſubmit to. This a King may do, he may inhibite a Miniſter to Preach in his Dominions, and the Miniſter ſo diſcharged, ought to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and not counteract, even ſuppoſe he think, the King and the Law wrongs him, eſpecially when there are others to preach the Goſpel, though he, or ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry be ſilent. May be you have heard what <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith to this caſe, <hi>Epist.</hi> 12. In anſwer to ſome in <hi>England,</hi> if in caſe the Queen <hi>(Elizabeth)</hi> and the Biſhops would either have Miniſters Preach on their Terms, or not at all; they might Preach, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Prohibition of Authority: To which he anſwereth, <hi>Tertium enim illud nempe ut contra Regiae-Majestatis &amp; Epiſcoporum voluntatem Miniſterio ſuo fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantur,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:95586:109"/> magis etiam exhorreſcimus,</hi> i. e. <q>As to the third, to wit, that Miniſters exerciſe their Miniſtry contrary to the will of the <hi>Queen</hi> and the Biſhops, is a thing we yet more abhore.</q> Next, Theſe who preach among you make themſelves Miniſters of the whole Church, without any fixt or ſettled charge.</p>

                     <hi>I have heard ſay that every Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, is a Miniſter of the Catholick Church.</hi>

                  <p>That it is true, and that you may ſee in what ſenſe, and on what grounds we ſay ſo againſt <hi>Independents,</hi> read Mr. <hi>Rutherfoord</hi> in his due right of Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, <hi>pag.</hi> 204. (though wrong figured) and he tells you, that though a Paſtor be Paſtor of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, yet he is not a <hi>Catholick</hi> Paſtor of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, as were the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. And that by a Calling, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, he is made a Paſtor, but by Election is to be reſtricted to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily the Paſtor of his Flock: So Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> on <hi>Rev. pag.</hi> 106, 107. ſaith, <hi>a Miniſter, though he be a Miniſter of the Catholick Church, yet is not a Catholick
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:95586:109"/> Miniſter of the Catholick Church, and that there is great odds betwixt theſe two. The Apoſtles,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>were Catholick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Catholick Church, and ſuch the Pope claims to be, that is, to have an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate acceſs for exerciſing his Office equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and indifferently to all places. Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> ſaith he, actu primo, <hi>have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and power to be Miniſters of the whole Church, and Watch-men of the whole</hi> Citie <hi>indefinitly: Yet,</hi> actu ſecundo, <hi>They are ſpecially delegated for ſuch and ſuch Congregations, and Poſts.</hi> But Miniſters among you have made themſelves <hi>actu ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundo,</hi> Miniſters of all the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Countrey where they can come. And from this followeth a third ſtep, they incroach, and intrude upon the Charges of other men, of which, I ſpoke before, and now only ſhall que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion you by what Authoritie they do ſo: What call have they to preach, and adminiſter the Sacraments to people of another Miniſters Charge, not being called, or deſired by the Miniſters of thoſe people, ſo to do? Their call is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ordinary or extraordinary. <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> they have none, never being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:95586:110"/> to be Miniſters of thoſe Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor ſo much as imployed by the Miniſter of the place, to exerciſe any Miniſterial act among his people. And for an <hi>Extraordinary</hi> call, I think they will not pretend to it. It may be ſeen by Acts of Councils in ancient times, how the Church hath guarded againſt this kind of incroaching by one upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers Charge: Otherwiſe what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, and abſurdities would inevitab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow? When theſe Miniſters who went to <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> to perſwade the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the National Covenant, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there without leave of the Miniſters of the place, the <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> asked them, how it was, that without their conſent, and againſt their will, they publickly preached to the people of their Congregations? Which they tell them was a thing repugnant to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and to Canons of ancient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. I might further let you ſee by what practices miniſters among you advance this <hi>Schiſm.</hi> They are careful to or dain men of their own way, that hereby the Schiſm might be perpetuated, and kept on foot. They are much in inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:95586:110"/> againſt <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Curats</hi> (as they call the Miniſters) Hereby to alienate the minds of people from their own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors. Of late they have great mixt communions, at which, perſons igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the common principles, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious perſons, may be, and I little doubt are admitted, it being hardly poſſible by their way, to keep them back. I might alſo ſpeak of their great diſſwaſives to people, not to hear their own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and of their ſtrange, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful uncharitableneſs to ſuch as differ from them, which ſin, they have with too much unhappie ſucceſs diffuſed among their ordinarie hearers. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith to this purpoſe, in the preface to his <hi>Cure of Church diviſions, To Preach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out love, and to hear without love, and to pray without love, to any that differ from your Sect: O what a loathſome Sacrifice is it to the God of Love? If we muſt leave our Gift at the Altar, till we are reconciled to an offended brother, what a gift is theirs, who are unreconciled to almoſt all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt, or to multitudes of their Brethren, becauſe they are not of their way: Yea, that make their Communion the very
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:95586:111"/> badge and means of their uncharitableneſs, and diviſions.</hi>

                  <p>I <hi>cannot deny but there may be ſome truth in theſe things, I have heard, from you. And now</hi> I <hi>muſt take my leave, and ſhall have my thoughts of what hath paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us, now and then, when I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</hi>

                  <p>Do ſo I pray you, and ſeek Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination from God, and that he would remove prejudices, which too oft ſtand in the way of our embracing Truth. Only let me give you a few advices fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before we part. And 1. Be not too confident of your own opinions, as if you were undoubtedly in the right, but conſider ſeriouſly what I have ſaid, to inform you at our three Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. 2. Think not that the matters in debate among us, are the very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials of Religion, or that people may not be of different perſwaſions in theſe things, and yet both ſides main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Love, and Church fellowſhip: for this were to run unto manifeſt ſin, and evil, <hi>viz. Schiſm,</hi> which is a renting of Chriſts body, the Church, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting publick Ordinances, upon
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95586:111"/> fears of what is only diſputable, and ſuppoſed to be evil. There have been far greater differences among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in former times, and yet Church-communion not broken. I might ſhew you that not only different opinions about Church Government, hath been no hinderance to keep Proteſtants from joyning together in the Worſhip of God, and other parts of Chriſtian Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but alſo when ſuch as differed from others in the manner of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Worſhip, have been occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in one anothers Churches, they have without ſcruple conformed to the cuſtome of the Church, they were in for the time. I pray you conſider, if you Separate from the Church, becauſe of Biſhops, you ſhould on this ground have been a Separatiſt, in almoſt all ages, ſince Chriſtianity began: And if you think Epiſcopacy ſuch an error, and corruption, that none ought to hold communion, with a Church where it is; then you muſt think, Chriſt holds no Communion with ſuch a Church: and if ſo, then it will follow, that there have been ſundrie ages ſince Chriſts
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:95586:112"/> time, wherein he had no Church on Earth to keep communion with; Yea, that theſe thouſand ſix hundred years bygone, there hath been but rarely, and very ſeldom a true Church on Earth. And ſo what ſhould become of his Promiſes to his Church? that ſhe ſhould be built on the Rock, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her the gates of Hell ſhould not prevail: and that he would be with her alway unto the end of the World, And alſo this were to make Chriſt a head without members, a King without a Kingdom, &amp;c. Therefore, 3. Have chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for ſuch as differ from you in the time, and beware of either thinking, or ſaying, they have no grace, becauſe they are not of your way. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpends a whole Chapter in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending, and recommending chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>chap.</hi> Among whom there were corruptions, and differences, in greater matters than among us, 1 <hi>Cor. chap.</hi> 11. and <hi>chap.</hi> 15. And remember, it's uſual with thoſe, who have leaſt truth on their ſide, to have leaſt charity too, <hi>Rom. chap.</hi> 14. Theſe weak Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:95586:112"/> who underſtood not their liberty in being looſed from the Cerimonial Law, as they had leaſt truth on their ſide, in reſpect of the ſtrong, who knew their liberty; ſo had they leaſt charity, for, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>They judged the ſtrong. Papiſts</hi> will have no charity for <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> yet <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who are in the right, dare not met back to them with that meaſure. 4. Conſider what hazard we bring our ſelves under, by our unchriſtian diviſions, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Mark</hi> 3.24. And what advantage we give to the common Enemy, not only to make us a mock, but alſo a prey. It was long ago obſerved by the Hiſtorian <hi>Dum ſinguli pugnant, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſi vincuntur.</hi> i. e. While they fight among themſelves, they are all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. And the Story of <hi>Scilurus,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining his Sons to maintain concord among themſelves, which he elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examplified by the Sheaf of Arrows, is known. 5. Acquaint your ſelf with the writings of the old non-conformiſts in <hi>England, Cartwright, Bredſhaw, Ball, Paget, Hilderſham,</hi> &amp;c. Who wrote, and teſtified againſt the <hi>Brouniſts,</hi> and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:95586:113"/> ſuch like <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> for their ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for which ſeparation, much more could have been pretended, than ye can for ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from us: And you will ſee, how zealouſly, and by what good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments theſe men battered down Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Alſo, Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> one of the preſent non-conformiſts in <hi>England,</hi> hath written a whole Book againſt Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from that Church, which he calleth, the <hi>Cure of Church diviſions,</hi> where he giveth ſixtie directions to people, to guard them againſt the ſin of Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſome of which, I ſhall but name, omiting his enlargements. The 6. is, That we make not our Terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with any Church ſtricker, than Chriſt hath done. 7. That we have deep and true apprehenſions of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie and reaſons of Chriſtian unity, and concord, and of the ſin and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of diviſion, and diſcord; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what the Scripture ſaith here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. 19. That we engage not our ſelves too far in any divided Sect, nor Spouſe the Intereſt of any party of Chriſtians, to the neglect and injury of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:95586:113"/> Church, and the Chriſtian cauſe. 20. That we be very ſuſpicious of our religious paſſions, and carefully di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh betwixt a ſound, and ſinful zeal; leſt we father our ſin on the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

That we be not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender of our reputation, with any ſort of people on Earth, nor too impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of their diſpleaſure, cenſures, or contempt, but live above them. 26. That we uſe not our ſelves needleſly to the familiar company of that ſort of Chiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who uſe to cenſure them that are more ſober, catholick, and charitable than themſelves, &amp;c. Where he ſaith, if ever we ſhall have peace, and love recovered, it muſt be by training up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

That Chriſtians never begin too ſoon with doubtful opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, nor ever lay too much weight upon them. 41. That the bare favour of a Preacher, nor the loudneſs of his voice, or affectionate utterance, draw us not to admire him without a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſolid underſtanding, and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. 43. That we reject not a good
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:95586:114"/> cauſe, becauſe, it may be owned by bad men, and own not a bad cauſe, for the goodneſs of the Patrons of it. 44. That we take the bad examples of Religious Perſons to be one of our moſt perilous temptations, and therefore learn to diſcover what are the ſpecial ſins of Profeſſors in the age, we leave in, that we may be fortified againſt them. 56. Keep ſtill in our eye the ſtate of all Chriſts Churches on Earth, that we may know, what a people they are through the World, whom he keeps communion with, and may not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly ſeparate from almoſt all the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Chriſt, while we think we ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate but from thoſe about us. 60.

The old <hi>Engliſh</hi> non-conformiſts, though they did diſſent from the Ceremonies of that Church, and deſired a forbearance in thoſe things, as to their own pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, (which is not our caſe) yet fully declared againſt Separation, both

                     </bibl> The perſonal ſins of others are no warrant for Separation: For Chriſt himſelf and the Apostles did eat the paſſover and worſhip God, with one, who Chriſt ſaid had a devil, and ſhould betray the Son of Man, and was an unclean man, <hi>Joh. 13.11, 18.</hi> Ibid. If it be ſaid, <hi>Judas</hi> was neither convicted of his treachery againſt Christ, nor was he known to the Apoſtles by name to be the man: For
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:95586:116"/> ſome of them ſuſpected themſelves, and not <hi>Judas</hi> to be the traitor. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt told the Diſciples that they were an unclean ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that one had a devil: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though they knew not the man by name, who had the devil, yet they knew the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to have a devil, and to be unclean for that one man's cauſe, yet Chriſt and the Diſciples did communicat at that Supper, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of this.</q>

                     </bibl> The godly in <hi>England</hi> who refuſed the Ceremonies, and Biſhops, did well, not to ſeparate from the viſible Church
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:95586:117"/> in <hi>England.</hi> He ſaith indeed they ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Church in the worst and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part: which he understands of their diſowning Biſhops and the Ceremonies, but yet they kept communion with that Church in unqueſtionable duties, as is well known, all except the Separatiſts, againſt whom, Mr. <hi>Rutherfoord</hi> is here reaſoning, and againſt whom, the old Nonconformiſts did write. <hi>Ibid.</hi> If a Church be incorrigible in a wicked converſation, and yet retain the true faith of Chriſt, it is preſumed, God hath there ſome to be ſaved, and that where Chriſts Ordinances be, there alſo his Church preſence is: And therefore I doubt much if that Church ſhould be ſeparated from, for the caſe is not here as with one ſimple perſon, for it is clear, all are not involved in that incorrigible obſtinacy, and that is yet a true viſible communion in which we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main; for there is ſome <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with the Head Chriſt, where the faith is kept ſound and that viſibly. Though a private brother being ſcandalous and obſtinatly flagitious, be to be caſt off, yet are we not to deal ſo with an Orthodox Church, where the most part are ſcandalous. <hi>Ibid.</hi> I ſee not but we

                     </bibl> There may be cauſes of non-union with a Church, which are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſes of Separation. <hi>Paul</hi> would not ſeparate from the Church of the Jews, though they rejected Chriſt, till they openly Blaſphemed, <hi>Act. 13.44, 45, 46.

You ſee then that Mr. <hi>Rutherfoord,</hi> and the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Presbyterians, in their Book cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, teach, that neither perſonal faults, whether in Ministers or People (ſuppoſe they be real) nor yet real faults about the Worſhip of God, are ſufficient grounds

And, ſaith <hi>Jerom</hi> to <hi>Ruffinus, never bluſh to change thy opinion, for neither you, nor I, nor any perſon alive, are of ſo great Authority as to be aſhamed to confeſs, we have erred.</hi> The Lord bleſs us with Truth, and Peace, Peace be within the Walls of our <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and Proſperitie within her Palaces, and let them proſper who love her, and her peace. <hi>Amen.</hi>
